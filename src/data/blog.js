            <h2>Hello World! My Coding Journey Begins</h2>
            <p>I still remember the excitement of writing my first "Hello World" program during my BSc (Hons) Computing degree at Itahari International, which was connected with London Metropolitan University. It felt like learning a new language that could create magic on screen!</p>
            
            <p>When I started, I knew very little about programming. But with each passing semester, I discovered the beautiful world of creating things with code. It was like having superpowers to build websites, apps, and solutions that could help people.</p>

            <h3>What I Learned as a Beginner:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Starting Simple:</strong> Learning basic programming with Python and Java</li>
                <li><strong>Web Magic:</strong> Creating my first websites with HTML and CSS</li>
                <li><strong>Making it Interactive:</strong> Adding life to websites with JavaScript</li>
                <li><strong>Storing Information:</strong> Learning how databases work with SQL</li>
                <li><strong>Team Projects:</strong> Working with friends to build cool applications</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>From Classroom to Real Projects</h2>
            <p>The best part of my studies was when we moved from textbook examples to building real projects. I remember the joy of seeing my code come to life in a web application that actually worked!</p>

            <p>One of my favorite projects was building a simple student portal. It wasn't perfect, but it taught me so much about how different technologies work together. Every error message was a puzzle to solve, and every working feature felt like a small victory.</p>

            <h3>Fun Projects I Built:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>A weather app that showed local forecasts</li>
                <li>A simple online store for practice</li>
                <li>A portfolio website (just like this one!)</li>
                <li>A task management application</li>
                <li>A blog system with user accounts</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Growing Step by Step</h2>
            <p>After finishing my degree, I continued learning on my own. I discovered new technologies like React and Node.js, and each new thing I learned built upon what I studied at university.</p>

            <p>The foundation from my education gave me the confidence to keep exploring. I learned that it's okay to not know everything, and that every expert was once a beginner too!</p>

            <h2>Sweet Advice for New Coders</h2>
            <p>If you're just starting your coding journey, here are some gentle tips from my experience:</p>

            <h3>1. Be Patient with Yourself</h3>
            <p>Learning to code takes time, and it's completely normal to feel confused sometimes. Every programmer goes through this!</p>

            <h3>2. Build Small, Fun Projects</h3>
            <p>Start with simple things that interest you. A calculator, a to-do list, or a personal website are great beginnings.</p>

            <h3>3. Don't Be Afraid to Ask for Help</h3>
            <p>The coding community is very supportive. There are no silly questions when you're learning.</p>

            <h3>4. Celebrate Small Wins</h3>
            <p>Fixed a bug? Got your code to work? That's worth celebrating! Every step forward is progress.</p>

            <h2>Looking Forward with a Smile</h2>
            <p>My university journey was the beautiful beginning of my love affair with technology. It taught me that coding isn't just about writing instructions for computers – it's about creating, solving problems, and making things that can make people's lives better.</p>

            <p>I'm still learning every day, and that's what makes this journey so exciting. There's always something new to discover, and every challenge is an opportunity to grow.</p>

            <p><em>To everyone starting their coding journey: take it one step at a time, be kind to yourself, and remember that every expert was once a beginner. Happy coding! 💻✨</em></p>
